# Project 1 - *Harolds Wordle*

Submitted by: **Harold Ponce Saldivar**

**Harolds Worlds** is a fun and interactive word-guessing game inspired by the popular game Wordle. The app challenges players to guess a hidden 5-letter word within a limited number of attempts. With each guess, the app provides feedback on whether the letters are correct, incorrect, or in the wrong position, helping players narrow down the possibilities. The app features a fully functional on-screen keyboard, a clean and intuitive user interface, and a new goal word for each game to keep the experience fresh and engaging.
Time spent: **8** hours spent in total
